                    <p>Carol Danvers is a Human/Kree hybrid and a military warrior known as the high-flying super hero Captain Marvel. With no support from her authoritarian father, a young Danvers took to the sky in the Air Force by herself as a promising cadet, escalating to rank of colonel as an intelligence agent. Eventually, she was tasked to be a head of security at NASA, when it was infiltrated by the Kree operative Captain Mar-Vell. Accidentally subjected to the Psyche-Magnitron machine, Danvers was imprinted with energy from Mar-Vell's Kree Nega-Bands, which triggered the manifestation of her mighty abilities.

                    Initially adopting the name Ms. Marvel, she established herself as a vigilante and joined the Avengers. Her life was extirpated from her control after she was manipulated by the villain Marcus. Targeted by the mutant terrorist Rogue, she had her powers, memories and personality stolen away. After a very lengthy process, Danvers recovered her abilities, and forged a prominent super hero career on Earth and in outer space, allying herself with the X-Men, the Starjammers, the Avengers, and the Guardians of the Galaxy.

                    Ultimately, Danvers has gone on to adopt the mantle of Captain Marvel for herself. As the chief leader of the Alpha Flight Space Program, Captain Marvel was the protagonist of the Second Superhuman Civil War, being put in direct conflict with her teammate and rival Tony Stark, the Invincible Iron Man. More recently, Danvers has learned about her true heritage as the daughter of a Kree supersoldier named Mari-Ell, and has been struggling to cope with her status as a woman from two worlds. Moreover, she has been elected as the new chairperson of the Avengers, and leads the team to protect and safeguard the planet.</p>
